- 👋 Good day blokes - my name is Joe.

- 👀 I’m interested in Ethical Hacking and PEnetration Testing that involves networks, WiFi, & Web Application.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on a mobile WiFi Attack box using a Rasp Pi 4 and a host of other software tools to 
gather, exploit, and control WiFi targets.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Bug Hunting and the entire process on what tools to use, what online resources 
are available, and how to discover a vulnerbaility to exploit/RCE for final reporting. I'm currently working on my
own private Bug Hunts and taking my time to discover them.
